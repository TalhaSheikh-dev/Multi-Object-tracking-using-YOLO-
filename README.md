# Multi-Object-tracking-using-YOLO


The script is to track multi objects in a video. The model recongnize an object and assign it with the
respective category and its id. We will use YOLO v3, a pretrained model to the tracking. The output of the script is a video with multi object tracked on it
We can make this thing live as well with a bit of customization. 

# Output

# Requirements

- collections
- scipy

# Download
 Download the YOLO v3 weights from here and place it in the folder YOLO_weights

# How it works
Simple.py will contains all the code. You have to just run this to make everything works. You can change the input video here
```python
video_src = "../video_data/car.mp4"#0
